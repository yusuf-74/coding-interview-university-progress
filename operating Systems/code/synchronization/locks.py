Lock Module

This module provides three different implementations of a simple lock for achieving mutual exclusion in concurrent programming.
These implementations include:
1. Lock Using Disabling Interrupts
2. Lock Using Test-and-Set
3. Lock Using a Guard Variable

Note: These are simplified examples for educational purposes. In real-world scenarios, use synchronization primitives provided by your operating system or threading library for thread safety.

Classes:
    Lock: A lock class with acquire and release methods.

Functions:
    disable_interrupts: Platform-specific function to disable interrupts.
    enable_interrupts: Platform-specific function to enable interrupts.
    test_and_set: Atomically set a variable to 1 and return the previous value.

Constants:
    FREE: Represents a free or unlocked state for the lock.
    BUSY: Represents a busy or locked state for the lock.
